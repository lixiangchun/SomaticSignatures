	abstract = {All cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however, understanding of the biological processes generating these mutations is limited. The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the {APOBEC} family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in {DNA} maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, {\textquoteleft}kataegis{\textquoteright}, is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.},

Remarkably, these mutational processes are poorly characterized. Global sequencing initiatives are yielding catalogs of somatic mutations from thousands of cancers, thus providing the unique opportunity to decipher the signatures of mutational processes operative in human cancer. However, until now there have been no theoretical models describing the signatures of mutational processes operative in cancer genomes and no systematic computational approaches are available to decipher these mutational signatures. Here, by modeling mutational processes as a blind source separation problem, we introduce a computational framework that effectively addresses these questions. Our approach provides a basis for characterizing mutational signatures from cancer-derived somatic mutational catalogs, paving the way to insights into the pathogenetic mechanism underlying all cancers.},

We also describe benchmarking approaches that use real, rather than simulated, sequencing data to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity as a function of sequencing depth, base quality and allelic fraction. Compared with other methods, {MuTect} has higher sensitivity with similar specificity, especially for mutations with allelic fractions as low as 0.1 and below, making {MuTect} particularly useful for studying cancer subclones and their evolution in standard exome and genome sequencing data.},

In any given study there will be many other variables at play, such as the effects of age and sex on the disease. We show that in studies where the expression levels of thousands of genes are measured at once, these issues become surprisingly critical. Due to the complexity of our genomes, environment, and demographic features, there are many sources of variation when analyzing gene expression levels. In any given study, it is impossible to measure every single variable that may be influencing how our genes are expressed. Despite this, we show that by considering all expression levels simultaneously, one can actually recover the effects of these important missed variables and essentially produce an analysis as if all relevant variables were included. As opposed to traditional studies, the massive amount of data available in this setting is what makes the method, called surrogate variable analysis, possible.

	abstract = {Summary
All cancers carry somatic mutations. The patterns of mutation in cancer genomes reflect the {DNA} damage and repair processes to which cancer cells and their precursors have been exposed. To explore these mechanisms further, we generated catalogs of somatic mutation from 21 breast cancers and applied mathematical methods to extract mutational signatures of the underlying processes. Multiple distinct single- and double-nucleotide substitution signatures were discernible. Cancers with {BRCA1} or {BRCA2} mutations exhibited a characteristic combination of substitution mutation signatures and a distinctive profile of deletions. Complex relationships between somatic mutation prevalence and transcription were detected. A remarkable phenomenon of localized hypermutation, termed {\textquotedblleft}kataegis,{\textquotedblright} was observed. Regions of kataegis differed between cancers but usually colocalized with somatic rearrangements. Base substitutions in these regions were almost exclusively of cytosine at {TpC} dinucleotides. The mechanisms underlying most of these mutational signatures are unknown. However, a role for the {APOBEC} family of cytidine deaminases is proposed.

	abstract = {Summary: As applications of genome sequencing including exomes and whole genomes are expanding, there is a need for analysis tools that are scalable to large sets of samples and/or ultra-deep coverage. Many current tool chains are based on the widely used file formats {BAM} (Li et al. (2009)) and {VCF} or {VCF-derivatives} (Danecek et al. (2011); Purcell et al. (2007)). However, for some desirable analyses, data management with these formats creates substantial implementation overhead, and much time is spent parsing files and collating data. We observe that a tally data structure, i. e. the table of counts of nucleotides x samples x strands x genomic positions, provides a reasonable intermediate level of abstraction for many genomics analyses, including variant calling ({SNVs} and {InDels)}, copy-number estimation, mutation spectrum analysis. Here we present h5vc, a data structure and associated software for managing tallies. The software contains functionality for creating tallies from {BAM} files, flexible and scalable data visualisation, data quality assessment, computing statistics relevant to variant calling and other applications. Through the simplicity of its {API}, we envision making low-level analysis of large sets of genome sequencing data accessible to a wider range of researchers.
Availability and Implementation: The package h5vc for the statistical environment R is available through the Bioconductor project (Gentleman et al. (2004)). The {HDF5} system (The {HDF} Group (2010)) is used as the core of our implementation.

                                    wasteful and ineffective follow-up studies. The problem becomes
                                    acute for latent variables that are correlated with the primary
                                    variable. We propose a two-stage analysis to counter the effects
                                    of latent variables on the ranking of hypotheses. Our method,
                                    called {LEAPP}, statistically isolates the latent variables from
                                    the primary one. In simulations, it gives better ordering of
                                    hypotheses than competing methods such as {SVA} and {EIGENSTRAT.}
                                    For an illustration, we turn to data from the {AGEMAP} study
                                    relating gene expression to age for 16 tissues in the mouse.
                                    {LEAPP} generates rankings with greater consistency across tissues
                                    than the rankings attained by the other methods.},
